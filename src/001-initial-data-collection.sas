1. It is straightforward. 
2. This is the surprise that IBES users actually "see" on their screens or read in a headline.
3. We covered Compustat a bit in my other example and I assume you get more exposure to that, so I want to expose you to IBES.;

*However, there are some downsides to the surprise file that I can discuss in class.

Step 3: Link to Price data

*Looks like maybe Nichols and Wahlen use prices as of the beginning of the fiscal year;

*I don't know if we will get to Compustat data so let me quickly take price and MVE from crsp
*we will start the graph at day -5, so let me take price from day -6;

*a very important issue in stock market event studies is that trading days are not the same as calendar days;

*For example, if an announcement happens on a monday, we do not want day -1 to be sunday when the market was closed
we must look back to the previous friday, or for example if friday was a holiday it could be the previous Thursday;

*My favorite way to do this is to just create a trading calendar of all the days in crsp and use it to look up dates;

*Steps for calculating size adjusted abnormal returns:
1. Match the announcement to its annual size decile
2. Pull the returns to the appropriate size index
3. Pull the firm-specific returns
4. Fill in missing firm returns with the size index return
5. Cumulate each return series
6. Subtract the size index return from the firm return
